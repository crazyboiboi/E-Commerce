This is a web project that I worked on during my free time. It is written using ReactJS, CSS and Javascript. The web app is mobile responsive and it also utilises the MaterialUI library and the CommerceJS API where it act as the backend that engineers solution for the shopping cart and checkout process.

Basically, it is where I configured and added all necessary information about the shop item. As it also handles the checkout process, I am able to view the orders in the dashboard and integrate with Stripe as the payment gateway. The project has some Stripe integration implemented however it is not fully set up since it requires credit card details to activate the payment gateway in CommerceJS.
